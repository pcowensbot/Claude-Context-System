## 🎯 What is This?

The **Claude Context System** is a lightweight framework that helps Claude Code maintain continuity across development sessions. It's like giving Claude a notebook to remember your project's goals, architecture, decisions, and progress.

### The Problem

Every time you start Claude Code, it's a fresh session with no memory of previous work:

```
You: "Continue building the authentication system"
Claude: "I don't have context about what authentication system 
         or what we were doing. Can you explain?"
You: *explains everything again* 😫
```

### The Solution

```
You: "Continue building the authentication system"
Claude: "I see from CONTEXT.md we're implementing JWT auth with 
         refresh tokens. The login endpoint is done. Should I 
         continue with the signup endpoint?" 
You: "Yes!" 😊
```

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Session Memory** - Claude remembers across sessions
- 📝 **Automatic Documentation** - Track decisions and progress
- 🎯 **Clear Priorities** - Know what to work on next
- 🔄 **Pattern Consistency** - Maintain coding standards
- 🚀 **Zero Config** - Claude sets itself up
- 🌍 **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, Mac, Linux
- 📦 **No Dependencies** - Just drop in and go

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Add to Your Project

```bash
# Option 1: Clone directly into your project
cd your-project
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-context-system.git .claude-system

# Copy CLAUDE.md to project root
cp .claude-system/CLAUDE.md ./

# Option 2: Download just the CLAUDE.md file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/claude-context-system/main/CLAUDE.md
```

### 2. Start Claude Code

```bash
claude-code
```

### 3. Let Claude Bootstrap Itself

When Claude starts, it will automatically:
1. Find and read `CLAUDE.md`
2. Ask if you want to set up the context system
3. Gather project information
4. Create `.claude/` directory with all necessary files
5. Generate your project's context file

That's it! 🎉

---

## 📖 How It Works

### First Session

```
You: [Start claude-code]

Claude: Hi! I see this is a new project with the Claude Context System.

        I can set up a complete context framework that will help me:
        - Remember project details across sessions
        - Track architectural decisions
        - Maintain coding patterns
        - Log session history
        - Keep TODO lists

        This will create a `.claude/` directory with several files.

        Would you like me to set this up? [Y/n]

You: y

Claude: Great! Let me ask a few questions...
        What is this project called?

You: My Awesome API

Claude: What's the tech stack?

You: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL

Claude: What's the main goal/vision?

You: Build a RESTful API for our mobile app

Claude: ✅ Claude Context System is set up!
        
        From now on, I'll start each session by reading CONTEXT.md
        Let's get started! What would you like to work on?
```

### Every Future Session

```
You: [Start claude-code]

Claude: Hi! I've read the context for My Awesome API.
        
        I can see:
        - You're building a REST API with Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
        - The user authentication is complete
        - Current priority is building the posts endpoint
        
        What would you like to work on today?

You: Let's build the posts endpoint

Claude: Perfect! Based on the patterns in CONTEXT.md, I'll use:
        - Express Router for routing
        - Joi for validation
        - Async/await for database calls
        
        Let me start by creating routes/posts.js...
```

## 📁 What Gets Created

After Claude sets up the system:

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md                    # Bootstrap file (you add this)
├── .claude/                     # Generated by Claude
│   ├── CONTEXT.md               # Main project memory
│   ├── README.md                # System documentation
│   ├── sessions/                # Session logs
│   │   ├── .gitkeep
│   │   └── 2024-11-16-1430-auth-system.md
│   └── templates/
│       └── session-log.md       # Template for logs
└── .gitignore                   # Updated to ignore session logs
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Developers

**At Session Start:**
- Let Claude read `CLAUDE.md` automatically
- Briefly mention what you want to work on
- Claude will read context and be ready

**During Session:**
- Ask Claude to document important decisions
- Have Claude update CONTEXT.md for major changes
- Trust Claude to follow established patterns

**At Session End:**
- Let Claude create a session log
- Review and commit changes
- Claude will note priorities for next time

### For Claude

(These are built into CLAUDE.md)
- Always read `.claude/CONTEXT.md` first
- Check recent session logs
- Follow documented code patterns
- Ask questions when unclear
- Offer to create session logs
- Update CONTEXT.md when things change

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Perfect For

- ✅ **Solo Projects** - Keep track of your own progress
- ✅ **Learning Projects** - Document what you're learning
- ✅ **Side Projects** - Pick up where you left off weeks later
- ✅ **Prototypes** - Rapid development with memory
- ✅ **Refactoring** - Track architectural decisions
- ✅ **Long-term Projects** - Maintain context over months

### Also Great For

- 🏢 **Team Projects** - Shared understanding of patterns
- 📚 **Educational** - Teaching Claude your preferences
- 🔬 **Experimental** - Try different approaches, document results
- 📖 **Open Source** - Help contributors understand context

---

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Default Behavior

The system works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults. Claude will:
- Create a minimal CONTEXT.md structure
- Suggest session logs at the end of work
- Follow basic code quality practices

### Customization

You can guide Claude to create custom sections in CONTEXT.md:

```markdown
## 🔐 Security Guidelines
- Always sanitize user input
- Use prepared statements for SQL
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints

## 🎨 UI/UX Patterns
- Use Material Design components
- Mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## 📝 Commit Message Format
type(scope): subject

Example: feat(auth): add JWT refresh token logic
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Claude Doesn't Read CLAUDE.md

Make sure:
1. File is named exactly `CLAUDE.md` (capital letters)
2. File is in your project root
3. You mention it: "Read the CLAUDE.md file"

### Context System Not Setting Up

Ask Claude explicitly:
```
"I have CLAUDE.md in my project. Can you read it and set up 
the context system?"
```

### CONTEXT.md Getting Too Large

Claude will suggest solutions:
- Moving detailed docs to separate files
- Archiving old session summaries
- Creating topic-specific context files

### Session Logs Piling Up

Add to your project's maintenance routine:
```bash
# Archive logs older than 30 days
mkdir -p .claude/archive
mv .claude/sessions/$(date -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-*)*.md .claude/archive/
```
